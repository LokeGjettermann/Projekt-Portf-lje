In my spare time i like to be active and have a variety of hobbies. I strength train 5 times a week, and go for a run once a week. Other than my training i like to go fishing, playing with 3D printers and keeping myself updated with the latest tech such as laptops, desktops and smartphones etc. I also have a passion for cars, motorcycles and skiing.</p>
